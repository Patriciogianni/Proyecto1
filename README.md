# Proyecto1
Primer proyecto para practicar lo aprendido -- First proyect in order to practice what I`ve learned

# Presentation 

Hi, my name is Patricio and I`m a student in this wonderful world that`s call I.T

# Proyect Objective

In order to practice what i have learned, I create a program that insert an employee of a company in the database. 
It`s a ConsoleApp coding in C# whith OPP.

# Content

The employee would have a MENU with five options to operate with. Before the log in part wich is very simple. 
0- Is to add the new person into the Database with a file number on it. That number would become the one and only id and that is how the company will identify him/her.
1- Erase the File if, for some reason you need to do it again, you can... just erase it and that`s it. Start again.
2- You can search the file to see what data did you write for the person, and also modified if you find any mistake on it. 
3- You can see three lists. The definitive person created (with the file), only the person (without the file), and only the files.
   ¿Why three lists? Simply because I can and I wanted to show you how I manage the object List.
4- Statistic of what you are entering. I think every program have a minimum of short statistics, it`s nice, it helps, I like it.
5- Save and load data. This is very important, you can save your work, turn off the computer and turn on the next day with the information still in the system.
   ¿How? Because, when you saved it, all the information will be stored in a repository that is linked in the code (an XML file). 
   Tomorrow you will have to go to number five and recovered what you have done if you want to see all the information loaded.
   
# Conclusion   
   
It`s a very intuitive program where you can`t get lost. Easy, quick and put every part of my brain to the test.    
I have a lot of fun doing it. I`m proud. Is not perfect but it has the time and dedication I could possibly give.  
I learn so much in the practice and i will continue with this sort of selfthought method.
I hope you like it and i`m open for suggestion. I`m a student so every comment will be most appreciate.

Thank you for the time. 

Patricio.
